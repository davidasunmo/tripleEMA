Triple EMA trend following indicator based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D80KULtCbHw, used in the [Scalping bot](https://github.com/davidasunmo/TripleEMAScalpBot)

For use in cTrader. 

## NOTE

**THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT AND DOES NOT WORK AS IS**. The .csproj is incompatiable with VS2022, so in order to use it you will have to create a new indicator in cTrader and copy over each .cs file manually to get it to compile. You will also have to do the same for all the projects this depends on in the .csproj. When I find time to do this myself I will update this repo with a working version
